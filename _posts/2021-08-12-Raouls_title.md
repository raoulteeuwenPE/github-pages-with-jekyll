So this is y new blog.

I have no idea where this is going.

But you should definitely PANIC! We're fucking ourselves EVERY DAY when we don't cut CO2 emissions. That's the stuff YOU probably create by driving your gasoline car, 
by heating your house with natural gas etc. YES, you can keep heating your house and driving a car, but need to switch to a different energy source!!! And YES,
you're fucking up the world for your kids etc with EVERY DAY you postpone a switch. REALLY!
